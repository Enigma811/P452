1-D Heat conduction (d^2T/dx^2 + alpha*(T_a - T) = 0): Shooting Method (RK4)

Precision: 10^-4

Boundary Values:
T(0) = 40, T(10) = 200

Assume that the left end of the rod is kept at origin.
Length of rod = 10m

Initial guess for dT/dx: Random

Number of revisions to achieve given precision: 6

Estimated position at which T(x) = 100: 4.43579 m
