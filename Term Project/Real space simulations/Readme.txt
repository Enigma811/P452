This folder contains displacement simulations in real space for 1D lattice with non linear additions to the neighbour potential (as for the FPUT model).

The simulations are based on 1D lattice with fixed boundary conditions. The total number of sites includes N + 2 (one/n fixed on each end). Each file is named as per the releant paremeters' values. Preffix "iamt" denotes very long time of/n 100000 (10^5) steps, others with 20000 time steps. The step size has been kept uniform across simulations. The/n corresponding mode energy profiles have been plotted and can be found in caseplots. 

The x-axis denotes the spatial position and y-axis denotes the displacement of particle(s).
